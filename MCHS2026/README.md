**NOTICE:** I couln't figure out how to publish an entire 2026 WPILib VS Code project, so this is only the robot folder contents.
## Highlights
- Command-based paradigm
- Modular and scalable
- Makes something move
## Overview
This code is used in Robot Name, team 6488 of MCHS' robot for the 2026 season. I am Orlando Brslik, the coding captain of this team and originator of this repository. This repository exists so that anyone can write/use this code.
## Usage
It is permissible to share, use, and build upon anything in this repository.
## Installation
This is where the notice from before comes in.

Before you should even download this repository, you should:
- Install 2026 WPILib VS Code [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html)
- Create a new Java Command Robot (learn how [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vscode-overview/creating-robot-program.html))
Now to use this code for its intended purpose. I'll make the steps as easy as possible:
1. Find your project in File Explorer.
2. Find the **robot** folder (pathway is src > main > java > frc > robot).
3. Open the folder and delete its contents.
4. Now, download the repository as a ZIP file.
5. Navigate to the contents of the ZIP file.
6. Paste the contents of the ZIP file into the robot folder.

If you now open your project on 2026 WPILib VS Code, the code should be in the right place. You can now build and deploy your project succesfully.
